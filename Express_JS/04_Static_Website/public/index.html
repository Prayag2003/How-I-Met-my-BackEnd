    <h1> <span class="multiText">Banker's algorithm </span>
    </h1>
    <p> The bankers algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by
        simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state”
        check
        to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.</p>


    <p>Why Bankers algorithm is named so?
        Bankers algorithm is named so because it is used in banking system to check whether loan can be sanctioned to a
        person or not. Suppose there are n number of account holders in a bank and the total sum of their money is S. If
        a
        person applies for a loan then the bank first subtracts the loan amount from the total money that bank has and
        if
        the remaining amount is greater than S then only the loan is sanctioned. It is done because if all the account
        holders comes to withdraw their money then the bank can easily do it.
        In other words, the bank would never allocate its money in such a way that it can no longer satisfy the needs of
        all
        its customers. The bank would try to be in safe state always.
        Following Data structures are used to implement the Banker s Algorithm:
        Let n be the number of processes in the system and m be the number of resources types.
        <br>
    <h2> Available : </h2>
    <p>
        • It is a 1-d array of size m indicating the number of available resources of each type.
        <br>
        • Available[ j ] = k means there are k instances of resource type Rj
    </p>
    <h2> Max : </h2>
    <p>
        • It is a 2-d array of size n*m that defines the maximum demand of each process in a system.
        <br>
        • Max[ i, j ] = k means process Pi may request at most k instances of resource type Rj.
    </p>
    <h2>Allocation : </h2>
    <p>
        • It is a 2-d array of size n*m that defines the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each
        process. <br>
        • Allocation[ i, j ] = k means process Pi is currently allocated k instances of resource type Rj
    </p>
    <h2> Need : </h2>
    <p> • It is a 2-d array of size n*m that indicates the remaining resource need of each process. <br>
        • Need [ i, j ] = k means process Pi currently need k instances of resource type Rj
        • Need [ i, j ] = Max [ i, j ] Allocation [ i, j ]
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>The first subtopic of "Banker's Algorithm" is "Resource Allocation", which is a first-level subtopic. It has two
        second-level subtopics, "Safe State" and "Unsafe State". "Safe State" and "Unsafe State" are both at the same
        level,
        but "Unsafe State" is further indented to indicate that it is a subtopic of "Resource Allocation".

        Finally, "Unsafe State" has a third-level subtopic, "Deadlock Risk", which is further indented to indicate that
        it
        is a subtopic of "Unsafe State".</p>

                    1. There are two vectors Work and Finish of length m and n in a safety algorithm.

                    2. Each process should provide information to the operating system for upcoming resource requests,
                    the number
                    of resources, and how long the resources will be held. <br>
                    3. It helps the operating system manage and control process requests for each type of resource in
                    the computer
                    system. <br>
                    4. The algorithm has a Max resource attribute that represents indicates each process can hold the
                    maximum
                    number of resources in a system. <br>

                    2. The algorithm does no longer allows the processes to exchange its maximum needs while processing
                    its tasks.
                    <br>
                    3. Each process has to know and state their maximum resource requirement in advance for the system.

                    4. The number of resource requests can be granted in a finite time, but the time limit for
